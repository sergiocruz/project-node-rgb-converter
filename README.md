# RGB Converter

In this project we will create a HEX to RGB Converter and a RGB to HEX Converter.

Your code should go into `converter.js`, where we are exporting two functions: `rgbToHex()` and `hexToRgb()`.

Your job is to make sure those two functions work according to the specification.

## Running and testing code

1. Clone this repo and `cd` into repo directory
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm test` to make sure your code runs
